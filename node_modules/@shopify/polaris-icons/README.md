> This package exports a JavaScript file containing the Polaris icons that can be used by partners building on the Shopify platform, and contains SVG files in the [`/images/` directory](https://unpkg.com/@shopify/polaris-icons/images/).

Browse and search Polaris icons: <https://polaris-icons.shopify.com>.

## Getting started

Although it's possible to use this package directly, we recommend using the icons in this package through [Polaris React](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) in combination with the `Icon` component from that project. Make sure that your app is using Polaris React version 3.10.0 or higher.

## Installation

After you have Polaris React installed, you need to add Polaris icons as a dependency.

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install @shopify/polaris-icons --save
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), then use the following command instead:

```
yarn add @shopify/polaris-icons
```

## Usage

Import the `Icon` component from Polaris React and any icon from Polaris icons into your project.

1. Include the icon component from Polaris React:

   ```tsx
   import {Icon} from '@shopify/polaris';
   ```

2. Include an icon from Polaris icons:

   ```tsx
   import {AddMajorMonotone} from '@shopify/polaris-icons';
   ```

3. Pass the imported Polaris icon to the `source` prop of the `Icon` component:

   ```tsx
   <Icon source={AddMajorMonotone} />
   ```

### SVG files

For consumers who don‚Äôt use React, we provide SVG files within the `images` folder.
